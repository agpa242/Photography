                        <p>Given the pandemic, and the lack of field work, this has been an interesting rummage of a year. An opportunity, as a photog, to dive into the archive of what you have created in the past, seeing as you are not so busy creating
                            in the contemporary.<br><br>It’s a random life, this photog excursion. You take bounces, handle curve balls, rebound from setbacks, keep trying to accelerate your skills and create opportunities to use those skills. And, your
                            archive is a roadmap of that very haphazard endeavor, with its equivalently random encounters. It’s like a very broad-based, lifelong photo album. And, truly valuable, not only as your own personal history, but potentially
                            that of the people, characters and events of our times. Last week, Allen Murabayashi over at the Vision Slightly Blurred podcast cited the original of this blog, published in 2015, and a diptych tweet I did (see banner) in
                            the course of a discussion of political photography. This is an update. Some of these pictures here have never seen the light of day.</p>
                        <p>Tomorrow we will vote. This blog is not about that momentous exercise of citizenship, or about partisan politics. Lord knows there’s enough of that already around. It’s simply about two encounters, long ago, and the utterly unpredictable
                            collision course culminating on Tuesday.<br><br>Trump in ’87 for Newsweek, Biden in ’88 for People. Different magazines, different approaches. Trump was a week-long encounter, Biden just a day or so. Trump was in color, with
                            lights and an assistant.<br><br></p><img class="img img-fluid" src="assets/img/post41.jpg">
                        <p class="mt-5">For Biden, I was alone, no assistant, no flash, working with window light. I’m a generalist, doing what the job requires, so I was comfortable with both approaches.<br><br></p><img class="img img-fluid" src="assets/img/post42.jpg">
                        <figure></figure>
                        <p>I think perhaps the stories, and the way I had to approach them, might have mirrored the men. Trump was in color, all glitz, powerhouse ego, and I did my requisite lighting and staging.<br><br></p><img class="img img-fluid" src="assets/img/post43.jpg">
                        <p
                            class="mt-5">I met Biden at the station in Wilmington, and we shook hands and shared a Metroliner to DC and hence to his Senate office. Shot B&amp;W, available light, all day. The Trump days were often set up and wait. With Biden, it was shoot
                            and move, shoot and move, all day, camera bag over my shoulder.</p>

                    <p class="mt-5">Trump gadded about in what he claimed at the time was the only non-military Puma helicopter in service in the world.</p><img class="img img-fluid" src="assets/img/post46.jpg"><img class="mt-5 img img-fluid" src="assets/img/post47.jpg">

                        <p class="mt-5">We spent a lot of time in the reception area in Trump’s offices, waiting to shoot scenes from his day. Trump had a former Playboy bunny as a receptionist, who evinced more than a passing interest in my very good- looking assistant
                            at the time. We were setting up for the cover shoot and a maintenance guy came back with a note marked, “For Joe’s Assistant.” She didn’t know his name, but that really didn’t matter.</p><img class="img img-fluid" src="assets/img/post49.jpg">

                                world you are assigned to, and you make pictures. In that tweet I made last week, I mentioned LIFE photog Bill Eppridge’s wonderful quote about what we do as photojournalists. “Reporters listen, photographers look.”<br><br>And
                                those looks can stick with you, amazingly. These jobs were shot in the late 80’s! And soon one will be president.<br><br>What an intriguing and forever relevant thing we do, us photog types. Make pictures of our life and
                                times, and the people who populate them.</p>
